_G.MoreSFX = true -- unused rn --(Recommended if you want more spicier sfx than just official tsb sfx for kj)

--[[ NOTES:
ULT IS UNFINISHED
Get Ultimate 1 by standing still, get Ultimate 2 by walking while Ulting
Critical Blow will change depending if u use Barrage before it
Ravage does 46.5% Damage
Use Variants of 1 or 2 by holding jump button
Five Seasons Auto Aims towards the nearest target at a range of 1500 studs (they cant escape)
Five Seasons might break for some users that dont have good pcs
VARIANTS RELY ON GOOD PING

TIPS:
Stoic Bomb's Range is further on the front by a little
Dropkick's Run goes faster in air, but is harder to aim
Using death counter wont give ur base movesets names back, which breaks the script,
which also allows you to keep no stun on, but sacrifices the ability to use Variants
To do the M1 tech, u gotta sidedash, m1, and jump, at the same time
Downslam + Critical Blow Variant acts the same way as Deadly Ninja's Whirlwind Kick,
which basically means that if u use Downslam and then use Critical Blow right when they get up,
it will make then downslammed again (big combo extender)
